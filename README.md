The Automotive Marketplace is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This platform connects vehicle sellers and buyers in a simple and efficient way.

Sellers can create listings by uploading their vehicle photos and providing all necessary details such as model, price, and specifications. Buyers can browse available vehicles, view detailed information, and contact sellers directly for further discussions.

The project focuses on providing a user-friendly interface, secure data handling, and smooth communication between buyers and sellers. It demonstrates strong implementation of CRUD operations, image upload handling, and REST API integration — showcasing practical full-stack development skills
